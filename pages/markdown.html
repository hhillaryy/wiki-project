    <h1>Markdown</h1>
    <h2>What is Markdown?</h2>
      <p>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).</p>
      <p>Markdown is mostly used for creating a READMEs file for GitHub or other applications. A README is how we document our code, give specific instrctions on how to run it, or explains bugs contained.</p>
      <p>Thus, Markdown is two things: (a) a plain text formatting syntax; and (b) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. </p>
      <p>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like its been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.</p>

      <h2>How to Apply Markdown:</h2>
      <p>Here we will explain the basic elements of a markdown page. If you would like to practice you may use <a href="http://dillinger.io/">Dillinger</a> to apply the concepts in real time. </p>
      <ol>
      <li>First you will want to create your main Header with a single hashtag (#) and whatever header or title text you want. Each subsequent header will be preceded by an additional hashtag (so second header would be ##, and so forth). There are six sizes total. Below your main header you will give a brief description of your project. You will not use any special symbols around this description because it is normal paragraph-level text.</li>
      <li>For text styling there are special symbols we may use. A single asterisk (*) will italicize your text. A double asterisk (**) will bold your text. To emphasize a section of text enclose it in an underscore (e.g. _be warned_).</li>
      <li>To create an <span class="ul-list">unordered list</span> we will also need to use the asterisk follow by one space between the text that follows. To create an <span class="ol-list"> ordered</span> list we simply use regular numbers followed by a period.</li>
